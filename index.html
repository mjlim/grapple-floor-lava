        <h1>Grapple Tag: The Floor is Lava</h1>
        <p>tentative title. I felt like trying to get back into gamedev again so I'm having a go using physicsjs.</p>
        <p>concept: 2-4 player local multiplayer arena game with the following constraints:
        <ol>
            <li>everyone has a grappling hook that can be used to pull themselves towards walls or players towards themselves</li>
            <li>the floor is lava</li>
        </ol>
        <p>inspirations: <a href="http://www.starwhal.com/">starwhal</a>, <a href="http://maxistentialism.com/samuraigunn/">samurai gunn</a></p>
        <p>current status (may 8): multiple players at a time is working, attach controllers and push a button.</p>

        <p id="status">gamepad api doesn't appear to be supported by your browser-- try chrome beta.</p>
        <script>
            if(navigator.getGamepads){
                var el = document.getElementById("status");
                el.innerHTML="looks like your browser supports the gamepad API.";
            }
        </script>
